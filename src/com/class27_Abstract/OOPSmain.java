	 * Inheritance- process when child/derived/subclass class inherots all property and behavours 
	 * from parent class
	 * 
	 * Supported by java classes:
	 * a.Single
	 * b.Multilevel
	 * c.Hierarchial
	 * 
	 * Supported by interfaces:
	 * d.Multiple
	 * e.Hybrid
	 *  
	 * Polymorphism- 
	 * 
	 * 
        Polymorphism implies same work done by several ways,i.e, same interface being implemented
         by different classes in different ways.
         
          It's of two types mainly:
        1)Compile Time Polymorphism : 
        This polymorphism occurs during compile-time of the program. 
        It is of two types : 
        *Method Overloading
        *Constructor Overloading
        *
        2)Runtime  Polymorphism : 
        This polymorphism is implemented during the runtime of the program. 
        It is of two types : 
         *Method overriding : 
         *It is the phenomenon in which child classes provide its own functionality for some function
         * in the parent class.
         *Upcasting :
         * Upcasting implies creating a reference variable of parent class to refer to child class.
         * 
	 * a.compile time/run time/early binding -achieved through method overloading(same name different parameters within same class)
	 * b.run time/ dynamic/late binding- achieved through overriding(same method name and parameters within Parent-Child)
	 * 
	 * Abstraction- process of hiding implementation details from the user and 
	 * showing only important info to the user.
	 * 
	 * to achieve abstraction:Two ways...
	 * 1.Abstract class- is a class in Java created using abstract keyword and have implemented 
	 * and unimplemented(using abstract key word)methods
	 * Defind and Undefinds methods
	 * 2.Interface-
	 * 
	 * Encapsulation
